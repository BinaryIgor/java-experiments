In text retrieval, full-text search refers to techniques for searching a single computer-stored document or a collection in a full-text database.
Full-text search is distinguished from searches based on metadata or on parts of the original texts represented in databases
(such as titles, abstracts, selected sections, or bibliographical references).

In a full-text search, a search engine examines all of the words in every stored document as it tries to match search criteria
(for example, text specified by a user). Full-text-searching techniques became common in online bibliographic databases in the 1990s.
Many websites and application programs (such as word processing software) provide full-text-search capabilities.
Some web search engines, such as AltaVista, employ full-text-search techniques,
while others index only a portion of the web pages examined by their indexing systems.
